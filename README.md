# Adrian's Dream Website

This is going to be a second option for the Adrian's Dream website. Built with React.

## Outline
The website will feature the following sections: About, Workshops, Gallery, Upcoming Events, Contact

## Testing
I wrote a few basic tests using Cypress to make sure that things are loading in properly. You can run the tests in the console by running npm run cypress:all.

## Planned Updates
The website is currently functional and can be found at https://www.adriansdream.com but I am still planning to build a backend in the coming weeks, mainly so that events don't need to be hardcoded.
